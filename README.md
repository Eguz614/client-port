# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

- This is my first real experience at building a website from the ground up. At first it was attempted to just complete the assignment but as more and more effort was funneled into the end product, I started to only think about coding and the issues I ran into. 

  - I built this project because I wanted to apply what was being taught in class and what I learned during my own studies. This Project is as worse as it can get ,and to be honest, it isn't overly bad. There is definitely room for refinement but I actually build my own website.

  - This website bridged the gap between studying and actually applying the methods and teachings from the previous week. Again, it's not perfect but it highlighted areas that need to be worked on (CSS POSITIONING,FLEXBOX,IMAGES,PSEUDO-ELEMENTS)

  - It's actually unbelievable to me that I could sit and work on a project for multiple days worrying about nothing but coding. From when I woke up to when I finally passed out I focused primarily on getting this site up and running.



## Function

  This website was created to display the current and completed work produced by the client in order to consolidate everything into one source. The site has multiple features that are beneficial for this day and age. The site is responsive on multiple platforms, the navbar has the ability to transform into a hamburger toggle button to reduce clutter and hyperlinks are embedded on the images so a mouse isn't required.
